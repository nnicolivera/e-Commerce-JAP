        <h1>Termination</h1>

        <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
        <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
            suppliers
            under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
            amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the
            Service.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
            for
            any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
            damages
            for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss
            of
            privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party
            software
            and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this
            Terms),
            even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the
            remedy
            fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
            party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h1>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
            without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
            behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers,
            expressly
            disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
            including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
            non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or
            trade
            practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
            representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
            compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
            meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
            corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
            representation or
            warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
            information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
            uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
            through
            the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the
            Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
        </p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You.
            But
            in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest
            extent
            enforceable under applicable law.</p>
